Project Description: 

1. In this application, restaurants update the left_over_food available before their closing time, which is available to the users and can purchase at a reduced price.
2. Data to be stored - [restaurant info, left_over_food, open positions at the restaurant]
3. Every food delivery application and all restaurant applications can use this database.
4. Many applications use the location to suggest the nearby restaurants, but they do not mention the left_over_food at the restaurant or reveal info about the open positions at the restaurant.
